I want to build a web app that helps my company's employees track and report their hourly work for different clients.

The app should have the following features:
- User authentication (just have the user provide their email)
- Ability to add, edit, and delete clients
- Ability to add, edit, and delete hourly work entries for each client
- Ability to view hourly reports for each client
- Ability to export hourly reports to CSV or PDF

Frontend: React
Backend: Node.js with Express
Database: SQLite in memory
